observers subscribed to it.  \
Returns a \`Subscription\` that can be used to unsubscribe from the source observable.

Returns an Observable that keeps track of how many subscribers it has.  \

When the number of subscribers increases from \`0\` to \`1\`, it will call \`connect()\`,
starting the execution.  \

When the number of subscribers decreases back from \`1\` to \`0\`, that is, when the output observable is
fully unsubscribed, it would \`unsubscribe\` from the subscription retuned from \`connect\`.

If you were created the \`ConnectableObservable\` by calling one of the \`publish\` operators, you can
replace it with a similar \`share\` operator, instead of calling \`refCount\`.`
